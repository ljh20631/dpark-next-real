                  <b class="bbb2">WARNING</b>: It is hazardous for anyone other than a competent person to carry
                  out any service or repair operation that
                  involves the removal of a cover which gives protection against exposure to microwave energy.
                </p>
                <p><b class="bbb2">WARNING</b>: Liquids and other foods must not be heated in sealed containers

                <p>
                  Any modifications or repairs must be performed by qualified personnel only.<br />Do not heat
                  food or liquids sealed in containers for the microwave function.<br />
                  Do not use benzene, thinner, alcohol, or steam or high-pressure cleaners to clean the
                  oven.<br />Do not install the oven: near a heater or flammable material; locations that are
                  humid, oily, dusty or exposed to direct sunlight or water; or where gas may leak;or an uneven
                  surface.<br />
                  This oven must be properly grounded in accordance with local and national codes.<br />Regularly
                  use a dry cloth to remove foreign substances from the power plug
                  terminals and contacts.<br />Do not pull, excessively bend, or place heavy objects on the power
                  cord.<br />
                  If there is a gas leak (propane, LP, etc) ventilate immediately. Do not touch the power
                  cord.<br /> Do not touch the power cord with wet hands.<br />
                  While the oven is operating, do not turn it off by unplugging the power cord.<br />Do not insert
                  fingers or foreign substances. If foreign substances enter the oven,<br />
                  unplug the power cord and contact a local Samsung service centre.<br />Do not apply excessive
                  pressure or impact to the oven.<br />Do not place the oven over fragile objects.<br />
                  Ensure the power voltage, frequency, and current matches the product specifications.<br />
                  Firmly plug the power plug into the wall socket. Do not use multiple plug adapters, extension
                  cords, or electric transformers.<br />
                  Do not hook the power cord on metal objects. Make sure the cord is between objects or behind the
                  oven.<br />
                  Do not use a damaged power plug, power cord, or loose wall socket. For damaged power plugs or
                  cords, contact a local Samsung service centre.<br />
                  Do not pour or directly spray water onto the oven.<br />Do not place objects on the oven,
                  inside, or on the oven door.<br />
                  Do not spray volatile materials such as insecticide on the oven.<br />
                  Do not store flammable materials in the oven. Because alcohol vapours can contact hot parts of
                  the oven, use caution when heating food or drinks containing alcohol.<br />
                  Children may bump themselves or catch their fingers on the door. When opening/closing the door,
                  keep children away.
                </p><br />

                <p><b>Microwave warning</b></p>
                <p>
                  Microwave heating of beverages may result in delayed eruptive boiling; always use caution when
                  handling the container.
                  Always allow beverages to stand at least 20 seconds before handling. If necessary, stir during
                  heating. Always stir after heating.
                </p>

                <p>In the event of scalding, follow these First Aid instructions:</p>
                <ol class="top-10" start="1">
                  <li>Immerse the scalded area in cold water for at least 10 minutes.</li>
                  <li>Cover with a clean, dry dressing.</li>
                  <li>Do not apply any creams, oils, or lotions.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>To avoid damaging the tray or rack, do not put the tray or rack in water shortly after cooking.
                </p>
                <p>Do not use the oven for deep fat frying because the oil temperature cannot be controlled. This
                  could result in a sudden boil over of hot oils.</p><br />

                <p><b>Microwave oven precautions</b></p>

                <p>
                  Only use microwave-safe utensils. Do not use metallic containers, gold or silver trimmed
                  dinnerware, skewers, etc. <br />Remove wire twist ties. Electric arcing may occur. <br />
                  Do not use the oven to dry papers or clothes. <br />Use shorter times for small amounts of food
                  to prevent overheating or burning. <br />
                  Keep the power cord and power plug away from water and heat sources. <br />To avoid the risk of
                  explosion, do not heat eggs with shells or hard-boiled eggs.
                  Do not heat airtight or vacuum-sealed containers, nuts, tomatoes, etc. <br />Do not cover the
                  ventilation slots with cloth or paper. This is a fire hazard.
                  The oven may overheat and turn off automatically and will remain off until it cools
                  sufficiently. <br />Always use oven mitts when removing a dish. <br />
                  Stir liquids halfway during heating or after heating ends and allow the liquid stand at least 20
                  seconds after heating to prevent eruptive boiling. <br />
                  Stand at arms length from the oven when opening the door to avoid getting scalded by escaping
                  hot air or steam. <br />
                  Do not operate the oven when it is empty. The oven will automatically shut down for 30 minutes
                  for safety purposes.
                  We recommend placing a glass of water inside the oven at all times to absorb microwave energy in
                  case the oven is started accidentally.<br />
                  Install the oven in compliance with the clearances in this manual. (See Installing your
                  microwave oven.) <br />
                  Use caution when connecting other electrical appliances to sockets near the oven.

                <p>Failure to observe the following safety precautions may result in harmful exposure to microwave
                  energy.</p>

                <ul class="indent">
                  <li>Do not operate the oven with the door open. Do not tamper with the safety interlocks (door

                  <li>
                    Do not operate the oven if it is damaged. Only operate after it has been repaired by a
                    qualified technician. <b class="bbb2">Important</b>: the oven door must close properly.
                    The door must not be bent; the door hinges must not be broken or loose; the door seals and
                    sealing surfaces must not be damaged.
